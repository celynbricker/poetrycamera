----------------------------------------

 In this room with windows wide,
A man sits at his desk inside.
His gaze is distant, lost in thought,
In the quiet, stillness he's caught.

The light outside, it softly shines,
Through the glass of his office window lines.
Each line and frame, they tell a tale,
Of a mind that's deep and unveiled.

His beard is trimmed, his hair is short,
A picture of calm, he's caught.
In this space, where thoughts are spun,
A world of ideas, yet to be undone.
